You can go on the internet and look for a list of the most common passwords used on the internet. 
After paste the list on the file passlist.txt that's where the python file main.py will look for the passwords to try them on the zip file.
Place the zip file inside the folder you will open with Visual Studio Code together with the passlist.txt file and main.py.
Edit the main.py file to replace the .zip file name.
If the reason you are using this is because you forgot the password and you have a few passwords that you normally use place those passwords on the passlist.txt file to determine faster which password it is.
